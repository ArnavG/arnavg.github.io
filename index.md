Hi, my name is Arnav Gurudatt. I graduated from UC Berkeley double majoring in Statistics and Data Science, and I'm currently pursuing a research-based Master's in Data Science at UChicago. I don't exactly have a grand vision for my personal website; I'll probably just use it as a place to share things I find interesting through my blog.
