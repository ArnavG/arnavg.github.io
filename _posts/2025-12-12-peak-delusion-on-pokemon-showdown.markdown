Sort of off-brand blogpost from me but I genuinely could not believe the levels of delusion I was reading while playing Gen 6 random battles on Pokémon Showdown today.

Quick board state summary: I am convincingly up 5 mons to 1. I have a Toxic-poisoned Cofagrigus with 38% HP that will take 31% toxic damage next turn (+6% HP recovery with Leftovers), staring down a 73% HP Choice Band Escavalier. Escavalier has 82 speed, meaning my entire team – including my 101 speed Cofagrigus – will outspeed Escavalier. My opponent is going to lock into Megahorn, their Escavalier's strongest attack. In the back, I have:

- A 48% HP Politoed that will set up 5 turns of rain upon switch-in with Drizzle. Scald will do 40-47.4% to Escavalier in the rain and has a 30% chance to burn.
- A 14% HP Togekiss that quadruple-resists Escavalier's Bug-type Megahorn with its Fairy-Flying type. Even though I'm at 14%, I have Roost to heal 50% HP (at the cost of losing the Flying type for that turn). Even with just a double-resist, I will take 42.8-50.3% from Megahorn, meaning I will outheal Megahorn on average and take -0.3% on a max roll (barring a 1/16 critical hit chance, in which case I take 64-75.7% damage). But with Leftovers recovery, I have a 15/16 chance of having an HP net gain at the end of each turn.
- A full HP Choice Band Basculin that does 53.3-63.5% with 100% accurate Waterfall, which gets bumped up to 80-94.9% in the rain set up by Politoed. Escavalier one-hit KO's me back with Megahorn, but I outspeed handily (218 vs. 82).
- A 45% HP Meganium with does 23.1-27.4% with Earthquake. Escavalier will OHKO me back with a super effective Megahorn.

In fact, this board state is so lop-sidedly in my favor that my opponent already said "gg" to me 4 turns ago:

<img src="/assets/article_images/2025-12-12-images/already_said_gg.png" alt="Opponent Already Said GG On Turn 27" title="Opponent Already Said GG On Turn 27" height="500">

Now, I actually do have a guaranteed win if I let Cofagrigus go down without damaging Escavalier: switch to Politoed and set up the rain, click Scald – we'll say I get a minimum roll of 40% and no burn – bringing Escavalier down to 33% HP, let Politoed go down to Megahorn, then switch into Basculin and click Waterfall for a guaranteed OHKO. Clean, simple, literally no way for me to lose.

However, I also have an 85% chance on this turn to burn the Escavalier with Will-o-Wisp, halving all of its damage output. That'll turn OHKOs into 2HKOs, allowing me to get more attacks off even if I can't OHKO back for whatever reason. Escavalier will also take 12% burn damage each turn which should hasten the match.

So that's exactly what I do – lock into Will-o-Wisp, and by the fate of an 85% in-my-favor coin flip, I land. To add insult to injury, my opponent lands on the unlucky side of *their* 85% in-their-favor coin flip by missing Megahorn.

Like I said, this outcome literally does not matter, because I could have missed Will-o-Wisp and they could have landed Megahorn and I would just go into Politoed after Cofagrigus fainted for my guaranteed win condition. But my opponent starts malding, probably upset they're down 1-5 and have been getting absolutely owned the entire game. I mean, look at this play where I read their life on a Belly Drum Extremespeed from their Linoone by switching into Cofagrigus, making their 4x attack Linoone faint without even getting off a hit...it was this very play that prompted the poor fellow to say "gg."

Anyway, now that their Escavalier is burned, I know I've pretty much locked up the game, so now I want to play for a 5-0 victory instead of a 4-0 victory purely for imaginary bragging rights. I switch into my 100% HP Basculin, which will survive even a critical hit max roll Choice Band Megahorn from burned Escavalier (78.9-93.1%), allowing me to click Waterfall the next turn and pick up the KO and 5-0 victory. KEEP IN MIND: I would not have switched into Basculin had the Escavalier not been burned by Cofagrigus' Will-o-Wisp. I already know the win condition, I already know that's an OHKO, and I am not that stupid.

Unfortunately, my opponent does not have that same faith in me, and for some reasons thinks that if I had just missed Will-o-Wisp with my Cofagrigus, all they would have to do is hit all their Megahorns to get a victory.

As it should be clear by now, this is beyond moronic. Like I already said, me missing Will-o-Wisp and them hitting Megahorn does nothing to change the outcome of the battle since I already have a 100% guaranteed win condition. But let's entertain this idiot and say that I miss Will-o-Wisp and they miss Megahorn; my Cofagrigus would be on 13% HP the next turn (Leftovers recovery minus Toxic damage) and I would just click Will-o-Wisp again! The probability of landing at least 1 Will-o-Wisp in 2 turns is $$1 - (0.15)^2 = 0.9775%$$. And let's say for some reason I missed that Will-o-Wisp too; regardless of whether Escavalier hits the next Megahorn or not, my Cofagrigus is still dying that turn to toxic damage at the very least, giving me a free switch into Politoed.

My opponent for some reason thinks I would have switched into Basculin anyway if I failed to land the first Will-o-Wisp. Why would I make such a stupid decision? I wouldn't, but given the way my opponent has been playing and some of their arguments, perhaps they are in fact stupid enough to make such a decision, so they're projecting their stupidity onto me.

But you know what, I'll entertain their stupidity for the sake of argument. Suppose I did switch into Basculin for shits and giggles after missing that Will-o-Wisp and them missing that Megahorn, because I like a challenge, I suppose. Even though my Basculin faints, **I still am guaranteed to win this game by simply outspeeding and outdamaging my opponent**.

With a dead Basculin staring down a 73% HP Escavalier that underspeeds my entire team, I would now have:
- A 48% HP Politoed that will do 40-47.4% to Escavalier with 100% accurate Scald in the rain. We'll even be nice and say we don't burn them (30% chance).
- A 45% HP Meganium with does 23.1-27.4% with 100% accurate Earthquake.

With literally just these two Pokemon, I already reach 73.1% HP worth of damage WITH TWO MINIMUM ROLLS. This doesn't even account for the fact that I still have:

- A 13% Toxic-poisoned Cofagrigus that does 27.4-32.9% with 100% accurate Shadow Ball.
- A 14% HP Togekiss that both has healing via Roost + Leftovers, resists Escavalier's only attacking option, and does 17.6-20.7% damage with 95% accurate Air Slash.

For me to lose this game from here, I would legitimately have to be actively trying to lose by clicking moves that don't damage the Escavalier (Toxic Spikes with Cofagrigus, Heal Bell with Togekiss, Toxic with Meganium, and Toxic with Politoed). The probability of the Escavalier only hitting 3 or fewer of its 14 remaining Megahorns is vanishingly small (number of Megahorn hits is distributed $$X \sim \text{Binomial}(14, 0.85)$$, so $$P(X \leq 3) \approx 0$$), so only by me literally throwing the match on purpose would my opponent's turbo-cope make sense.

Anyway, now that I've typed all of this up, I have realized that my opponent may have just been trying to ragebait me. And while the ragebait may have been ultimately successful, I think at the very least I held my own in the chatroom where I think I come off looking better than them. They don't know I wrote up this blogpost showing that they actually did get under my skin, so if they do find it, then congrats on a successful ragebait. And if you weren't trying to ragebait me, then you might be mentally incapacitated.
