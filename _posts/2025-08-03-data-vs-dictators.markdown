## BLS vs. Buffoon

On August 1, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) revised its May and June employment estimates significantly downward. Rather than reporting that the US economy added 291,000 jobs in May (144,000) and June (147,000), newer estimates report a comparatively paltry gain of only 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June, or a combined 33,000 jobs. Additionally, July job growth fell below expectations, adding 73,000 compared to the anticipated 104,000.

I'm not going to pretend the revision wasn't *significant*, since recent signs now point to slowing job growth amidst upward price pressure and economic uncertainty from tariffs. But the first point I want to make is that the jobs report itself wasn't particularly bad. The revision only has to do with *new* jobs added, not the total number of jobs, meaning a revision even at this magnitude wasn't even enough to budge the actual unemployment rate between the first estimate and its revision. The BLS estimates the *total* number of jobs each month, not the change in jobs, meaning the revision is around 0.16%, not 60-70% like some people have been claiming. We've had stable unemployment of around 4.0-4.2% for the past twelve months, and the July jobs report, all its revisions included, don't really change that fact.

So what's all the hoopla about with this jobs report? Well, like I said before, in sheer number, there's nothing really bad that sticks out, but the *slowing rate* of job growth is a cause for concern, a trend that started before the current administration but will certainly make for some rounds of negative press when the BLS revises its employment estimates downward like it did on Friday.

So what do you do when your own economic data officials point out that things may not have been all rosy and peachy as you've deluded yourself and your base into believing?

Fire the BLS commissioner, of course!

![Trump fires BLS Commissioner in Truth Social post](/assets/article_images/2025-08-03-images/trump_tweet.jpeg "Trump fires BLS Commissioner in Truth Social post")

In a better world, posting a statement this asinine about firing a nonpartisan official in charge of economic data collection for reporting data that makes you look bad is grounds to be impeached. Unfortunately, we don't live in that better world; we live in a world where our "president acts like a five-year-old," as Nobel Prize-winning economist George Akerlof wrote in his <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/card_img/1951956271541760001/9MBvzMQS?format=jpg&name=medium">New York Times guest essay</a> this weekend.

More broadly, Trump joins a long line of dictators who silenced data when it was politically inconvenient for them. He joins Andreas Georgiou, the Greek statistician who was <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/criminal-case-against-greek-statistics-chief-raises-eyebrows-in-brussels/">criminally prosecuted</a> for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101007143658/http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9541636">falsifying budget and GDP data</a> to downplay the Greek debt crisis and maintain Eurozone membership. He joins Guillermo Moreno, the Argentinian Commerce Secretary who <a href="https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/inflation-lies/">faked inflation data</a> when the country's clumsy price controls following their 2001 financial crisis did nothing to alleviate worsening hyperinflation (and also resulted in the firing of the statistician who was truthfully calculating CPI!). He joins censorious Chinese bureaucrats who <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-political-science/article/juking-the-stats-authoritarian-information-problems-in-china/3A9711B9C9A38CCFD7C31AD5D90344FA">manipulated and hid GDP data</a> to comply with Beijing's growth targets. And ‚Äì¬†while we're not quite there yet ‚Äì¬†he shares the same appetite for suppression of inconvenient information as Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, who jailed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-19/maduro-locks-up-economists-sharing-data-on-venezuela-s-decline?embedded-checkout=true"> at least eight economists and consultants </a> for honestly reporting that the country's economy was in decline.

No, I am not saying Trump and Maduro are exactly the same when I make this comparison. But Trump is in terrible company with this firing decision, in lockstep with the world's worst autocrats and authoritarians who lead economically unstable regimes.

As Akerlof writes:

> Past presidents respected this boundary. Ronald Reagan didn‚Äôt fire the head of the agency when it reported double-digit unemployment during his first term. Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama took bad news from official statistics on the chin. Mr. Trump has charted a different course. This is not his first tangle with truth. He has questioned unemployment numbers and dismissed Covid fatality figures as inflated. Removing the Bureau of Labor Statistics chief because the numbers were off narrative is a new breach. It is not only attacking the game; it is removing the referee.

Of course, Trump and his lackeys will play the same card they do every time something is inconvenient to his narrative, which is that the BLS commissioner was conspiring against him in some deliberate way, that the numbers were rigged to make him look bad, that they fudged numbers last year to make Kamala Harris look better for the election, or some other baseless bullshit that deflects blame onto anyone but himself for his own dumb economic policies.

On the Kamala Harris point: what Trump claims in his Truth Social post is just patently untrue; in fact, the opposite is true. The Biden administration's job numbers were revised *downward* by 112,000 right before the election (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/11/01/business/jobs-report-october-economy-election">as NYT reported on November 1</a>), and his narrative of partiality towards Biden and Harris ignores the fact that there were the same number of upward and downward revisions in 2024.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The White House anti-BLS webpage is basically nonsense.

Re: last Friday's job report, I'm not saying that this most recent revision wasn't significant, but it also requires some context about how these revisions work and the size of revisions historically. Generally, revisions have become more accurate over time, and save for recent periods of significant economic instability (2020 and 2021), current nonfarm payroll revisions are under 0.05% on average, much lower than the volatile swings in the 80s and 90s, and even lower than the early 2000s.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I like the chart below from <a href="https://twitter.com/ernietedeschi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ernietedeschi</a>, but I also made a slightly different version.

Not noticeably <a href="https://t.co/M27toO3uc5">https://t.co/M27toO3uc5</a> <a href="https://t.co/wEFBdLNhai">pic.twitter.com/wEFBdLNhai</a></p>&mdash; Jeremy Horpedahl ü•öüìâ (@jmhorp) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmhorp/status/1952383011321712886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But despite improving forecasts, the miss was still large relative to recent better standards, one of the largest misses since the 2008 recession. Trump world attributes this to some form of malicious incompetence though, when in reality it's basically just a statistical artifact.

First, it's *very* difficult to come up with routine, monthly snapshots of US employment data that are also accurate. Normally, we get our most robust numbers every 5 to 8 months from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), <a href="https://x.com/cullenroche/status/1951378186039861474">which uses employer-submitted payroll tax filings that covers 95% of US wage and salary jobs.</a>

But economic policymakers should be forward-looking and not have to rely on official numbers on a 5 to 8 month lag before making a decision while the economy is already on fire. (In fact, the inflation we saw in 2021-22 was exactly because the Federal Reserve was far too reactive rather than proactive with respect to economic data.) So timely monthly snapshots like those provided by the jobs report are incredibly important, but also more prone to noise because they come from survey data, which usually <a href="https://x.com/stanfordNYC/status/1951379352588779602">contain around 70% of the sample</a>. As we saw earlier, normally these survey estimates are "good enough" on their accuracy, and even relatively "big" revisions like we saw on the recent jobs report do not even budge the actual unemployment rate. The survey metrics are useful signal, and revisions of magnitude <0.05% are essentially just statistical noise in the bigger picture. And even though this particular revision was larger, there's no evidence to suggest it's part of some broader systematic problem (and ‚Äì¬†if anything ‚Äì¬†any systematic problems that caused the forecasting error are related to the economic uncertainty around Trump's economic policy).

So by now, it should be obvious that there was no deliberate manipulation of data to make Trump look bad. If the BLS commissioner had such a vendetta against Trump, why start faking the data now? She could have faked it back on May or June in the wake of Trump's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_stock_market_crash"> "Liberation Day" disaster.</a> Back then, JD Vance was <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1945469193756750065">singing the praises of the nation's economic data.</a>

But the second angle of Trump and his cronies' attack on the BLS is that the miss reflects *incompetence*, and thus a firing was warranted for the commissioner being bad at her job.

First, bad by what standards? Historically big miss relative to when? A miss so large and incompetent that the headline unemployment rate for each month did not even change? The reasoning is so bogus and incoherent, but that kind of haphazard double-think is necessary to succeed in Trump world.

But my broader point is that even if we do treat the size of the revision as hugely erroneous, it sets a terrible precedent to fire someone who is collecting and reporting data in good-faith and has a broader commitment to telling the truth. I'm not going to sit here and claim that statistics and data are inherently "objective" ‚Äì¬†as you'll see in the second part of this article, I argue that they can very much be wielded dishonestly, and more broadly, I agree with Andrew Gelman that we should probably <a href="https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/gelman_hennig_full_discussion.pdf">move beyond objectivity and subjectivity in statistics </a> to more useful constructs (e.g., transparency) ‚Äì¬†but fundamentally, people in charge of reporting economic data have a broader commitment to honesty, accountability, and some idea of truth, however we might define that. Sure, there's the direct impact of this fiasco on policymakers and the private sector footing your paycheck, who now have access to less reliable economic data to make good decisions, but my worry is about something deeper. The idea that simply *reporting* numbers that this administration found inconvenient was grounds to jettison the BLS commissioner from her job is appalling, and reflects that Trump and his ilk have little commitment to ideas like honesty, accountability, or truth. This is nothing new, and we're really beating the same dead horse we have since 2015, but the man was elected twice and people will continue to bend over backwards to run defense for his authoritarian tendencies.

I worry about the future of US economic data collection. The word has been thrown around a bit in recent days, but as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/janet-yellen-on-the-danger-of-a-banana-republic-economy">Janet Yellen foretold back in July</a>, the behavior we are seeing from Trump is something reminiscent of the leader of a dysfunctional banana republic, a nation whose numbers cannot be trusted due to the ruling party's distaste for transparency. The worst part of all of this is that it's not even the Trump administration's first attack on the BLS and economic data collection. DOGE had already <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/05/economy/cpi-data-bls-reductions">laid off BLS staff</a>, leading to jobs data collection being halted in Lincoln, NE, Buffalo, NY, and Provo, UT. They also disbanded <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-disbands-two-expert-panels-economic-data-2025-03-05/">two economic panels dedicated to fixing the very problems with survey-based data snapshots</a> ‚Äì¬†panels that were entirely voluntary and did not cost anything to US taxpayers! To whatever extent Trump is upset about the size of data revisions, his administration has actively exacerbated issues with data collection and dug their own grave, so I have little patience for sycophants like <a href="https://x.com/raydalio/status/1952383144218288460?s=46&t=St8OjHQk4i2By8wjjwWsNw">Ray Dalio</a> posturing that there should be some deeper commitment to methodological improvements in data collection when Trump has actively worked against any such reform.[^1] Lest you think the Trump administration cares deeply about accurate forecasting and that therefore justifies the BLS commissioner's firing, I want you to think long and hard on whether the commissioner would have been fired if she had revised the job data *upward* by the same magnitude.

Obviously, I have a laundry list of complaints against this Trump administration, and in the bigger picture, perhaps something like "suppressing data that makes you look bad" does not rise to the same level of terrible as <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuelan-migrants-deportations-el-salvador-prison-60-minutes/">"human rights abuses."</a> But I think this episode highlights a fundamental rot at the core of Trump's government; his flagrant disregard for truth and transparency in favor of narrative control reveals an administration more concerned with protecting its image than governing effectively or maintaining the institutional integrity that underpins a functioning democracy.

## Inoculation vs. Idiot

If Trump firing the BLS commish was the A Plot of this weekend's episode of hating data that disagrees with you, then HHS Secretary and noted anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1951423851314946083">tweet</a> and <a href="https://www.trialsitenews.com/a/flawed-science-bought-conclusions-the-aluminum-vaccine-study-the-media-wont-question-aaec2793">article</a> responding to a Danish vaccine study was certainly the statistically-misinformed B plot.

The study looks at "1,224,176 children born in Denmark between 1997 and 2018 who were alive and residing in the country at age 2 years," tracks these cohorts over 24 years, and finds that there was no association between aluminum exposure through vaccination and subsequent development of neurological disorders. Cool, great, nothing ground-breaking; the sane among us know that vaccines are generally effective and carry minimal risk relative to their upside.

Unfortunately, RFK Jr. is not sane, so he took the liberty of penning a very long and statistically illiterate response to the study.

First, RFK Jr. claims that the study deliberately excludes certain groups of children so as to make the results look more rosy, like excluding children who died before the age of 2. Calling this "exclusion" is a bit loaded as it suggests some deliberate bad-faith obfuscation of data, but he is correct that this is a deliberate design choice by the authors; the question is whether the choice is justified.

![Vaccine Study Flow Diagram](/assets/article_images/2025-08-03-images/vaccine_study_flow_diagram.jpg "Vaccine Study Flow Diagram")

The authors excluded around 12% of their initial cohort sample. Part of this was due to censoring[^2] ‚Äì¬†as the study notes, "6510 participants (0.5%) were censored during follow-up because of emigration or disappearance", which is not really the fault of the authors, "and 335 (0.03%) because of death." What RFK Jr. is dishonestly trying to suggest is that the children who died before the age of 2 (who only make up 0.03% of the sample!) all died from causes that can be attributed to neurodevelopmental disorders (or died with neurodevelopmental disorders), making this some deliberate cover-up by the authors. This is a plainly ridiculous claim, and I seriously doubt that whatever fraction of these babies died with some neurodevelopmental disorder is enough to overturn any of the study's findings. For the two largest reasons study participants were excluded ‚Äì¬†mothers not living in Denmark 2 years before birth and missing data ‚Äì¬†we have no reason to believe either of these two groups would have children with systematically higher rates of neurodevelopmental disorders (in other words, I seriously doubt the distribution of disorders among the children in these groups is different from the included sample). The authors also omit children with pre-existing conditions unrelated to neurodevelopmental disorders, since these children differ from the children in the included sample in a very systematic way that could confound the results of the study. All in all, there's no nefarious ploy to hide certain groups of children from the study, and whatever share of the sample was excluded was either (1) out of the author's control, (2) not enough to overturn the results of the study, or (3) judicious statistical practice.

One point RFK Jr. makes that's been making rounds though is that the study excludes over 34 thousand children who had "too many registered vaccinations containing aluminum in the first two years of life," which, according to the authors' supplemental table, includes children who "received >3 diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTP) vaccines, >3 Hepatitis B (HBV) vaccines, or >3 pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) vaccines by age 2." RFK Jr. describes this group as "highest aluminum exposure levels," so their exclusion from the comparison downplays the association between vaccination and neurodevelopmental disorders.

I don't think this is a terrible point to make, and it's one the authors have responded to. Their main contention is that it seems implausible or inconsistent with their other data that a child would have received this many vaccinations, since it's above the amount required from the Danish vaccination schedule, but they imply (?) that they did some sensitivity analysis with these children included:

> "Notably, the present study excluded 34,547 children (3% of the study population) with ‚Äútoo many registered vaccinations containing aluminum in the first 2 y of life‚Äù. It is however plausible that during this period, children could have received more than the recommended number of aluminum-containing vaccines. Some children registered as receiving more than three doses of one type of vaccine may simply have been cases of misregistration of the vaccine type received. This could easily be investigated by checking if the majority of children with an ‚Äúimplausible‚Äù number of vaccines were from 2014-17. If so, sensitivity analyses are indicated, including 1) an analysis without exclusion of children with ‚Äútoo many vaccinations‚Äù and 2) an analysis excluding the period with hexavalent vaccine."

I could not find said sensitivity analyses in their supplemental file, and I think it would be good to have them available. However, I think this entire point is largely overblown because the study's design *does* exploit natural variation in the dosing requirements from the Danish vaccination schedule to ascertain the association of higher aluminum exposure on neurodevelopmental outcomes, and the study's null findings survive these differences. For the sake of transparency, I'd be interested in including the aforementioned 34K kids in the analysis (wherever that might be), but I don't expect the findings to be overturned by their inclusion.

Funnily enough, if you actually look at the study's supplemental findings, when you use the group with the highest levels of aluminum exposure (3-4.5 mg) as your baseline, groups that had lower exposure ‚Äì¬†if anything ‚Äì¬†had *worse* atopic/allergic and neurodevelopmental outcomes, suggesting a protective effect from aluminum exposure in vaccines. (However, the study's findings are not causal, so neither I nor the study am claiming that adding more aluminum in vaccines will cause lower rates of allergies or autism.)

![Outcomes by Level of Aluminum Exposure](/assets/article_images/2025-08-03-images/vaccine_study_exposure_levels.png "Outcomes by Level of Aluminum Exposure")

So to RFK Jr.'s credit, I actually think this was the most astute point he made, in the sense that the other claims he made about the study were just outright false.

RFK Jr. claims that "the data show a statistically significant 67% increased risk of Asperger‚Äôs syndrome per 1 mg increase in aluminum exposure among children born between 2007 and 2018." The data supporting said claim is literally one cherry-picked subgroup out of 33 that were analyzed across two cohorts. The sample size of said cohort was just 51, and the 95% CI was (1.01, 2.77), which is *just barely* outside the "not statistically significant" threshold of 1.0 and implies anywhere from a 1% increase in risk to a 177% increase in risk (or nearly 3x the risk). Such a wide interval that teeters that close to insignificance should be treated as a sign of large uncertainty with a subgroup that small, not fear-mongered about to rabid mobs of anti-vaxxers on Twitter.

![Outcomes by Age Cohort](/assets/article_images/2025-08-03-images/vaccine_study_findings.png "Outcomes by Age Cohort")

The other more subtle factor here has to do with the chance of finding a false positive in null hypothesis significance testing. When we set a p-value threshold of 0.05 or construct a 95% confidence interval, we are essentially putting a large-sample guarantee on the number of false positives we will find, which in this case would be a false positive in 5% of samples. Across 66 tested outcomes with a 5% false positive rate, we are expected to find 3 false positives (assuming no real effects) if we don't make some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate">confidence threshold correction</a>. Another way of framing this is that subgroup analysis is prone to these types of false discoveries because of the inherent randomness in sampled data. When you sample data at random and slice and dice it a certain way, inevitably, you're going to make some spurious discoveries in this particular sample of data that likely would not hold up if you resampled the data once again. For a humorous illustration of this idea, see this xkcd comic:

!["Significant" by xkcd](/assets/article_images/2025-08-03-images/xkcd_jellybeans.png "\"Significant\" by xkcd")

I wanted to address one last point raised by RFK Jr. and his fellow vaccine skeptics, which is that this study did not include a randomly-assigned control of unvaccinated children, meaning you do not have an "all-else equal" comparison of outcomes based on aluminum exposure.

One issue with this is that it's not really ethical to randomly assign children to be unvaccinated. Imagine you ‚Äì¬†a sensible person ‚Äì¬†want to vaccinate your children when they are born, but some random stats nerds come up to you and say, "Sorry, your child has been randomly assigned to the unvaccinated control group." And then your child dies of measles or something. While RCTs are one "gold standard" for causal inference, there are other very robust methodologies that allow you to conduct appropriate causal inference despite not having a randomized treatment and control group.

Another issue with this point is that *including* this control group would mean you don't have the "all-else-equal" comparison the critics speak of, because parents who don't vaccinate their children differ in systematic ways (lifestyle, parents' socioeconomic status) from parents who do vaccinate their children.

But the authors actually *did* include the 15,237 children who did not get vaccines with aluminum in their main findings, and ran a separate sensitivity analysis without these children and found that their results were essentially unchanged:

> Dr Paul Koshy also expressed concern that unvaccinated children were excluded and that this was not reflected in the cohort construction flow chart. Our main analyses did not exclude unvaccinated children. However, excluding unvaccinated children in subsequent sensitivity analyses yielded results consistent with our main findings.

So the whole point about not having a proper control is pretty unfounded, because (1) it's not even clear-cut that this is an appropriate control group, and (2) whether you include this group or not does not overturn the study's findings. The study is overall very well-designed; it's a large, longitudinal study that cleverly tests outcomes at various levels of aluminum exposure, and provides strong evidence against any damaging effects of aluminum in vaccines. Good stuff!

Obviously, RFK Jr. is a complete crackpot, but my broader worry is that his critique actually sounds *right* without any further investigation. He raises seemingly valid methodological criticisms, and he even cites other research in published journals that ostensibly confirm his contention that there are neurotoxic effects from aluminum in vaccines. RFK Jr. weaponizes the language of data integrity and statistical skepticism to baselessly discredit valid research that clashes with his priors, and it's not even the first instance of him doing so. <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/01/rfk-jr-cites-flawed-paper-claiming-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-in-hhs-confirmation-hearing/">During his Senate confirmation hearing</a>, he cited a study linking vaccines with autism that had been thoroughly discredited by the broader scientific community, but that study had nonetheless appeared in a peer-reviewed journal.

Of course, the conspiratorial world inhabited by cranks like Trump and RFK Jr. will call any sort of scientific consensus "the medical establishment," any sort of pushback on completely bullshit theories and studies as "silencing disagreement." I'm not claiming the medical establishment is perfect and has a squeaky clean record, but it fundamentally goes back to good-faith pursuit of transparency, consensus, and impartiality ‚Äì¬†something I'd describe as a commitment to some sort of honesty ‚Äì¬†that is sorely lacking from this administration. Andrew Gelman had a <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2025/08/03/you-can-cite-peer-reviewed-research-in-support-of-almost-any-claim-no-matter-how-absurd/">timely blogpost</a> while I was writing this article, aptly titled, "You can cite peer-reviewed research in support of almost any claim, no matter how absurd." It's something I definitely resonate with. I've had people bring up completely bullshit studies about food science or supplements, barely having read the actual paper, but confidently proclaiming that it confirms their priors (and, I'm ashamed to admit, I've done the same thing ‚Äì¬†not recently, but back in high school, where citing random bogus papers you find from a cursory Google search online is how you win an online argument). I call this brand of bullshit papers ScienceSlop, and it's really unfortunate that even legitimate peer review can proliferate basically fraudulent research in reputable journals.

The frustrating part about all of this is how much effort it takes to sift through and correct scientific misinformation if you're doing your due diligence. People like to think they have some enlightened healthy skepticism about science, research, etc., but really, people will just blindly accept any sort of ScienceSlop that comes their way as long as it confirms their priors.[^3] I'm also not immune to this; I'd like to think I'm past the point of uncritically accepting the findings of every study that graces my Twitter timeline, but I'm also not reading the actual study and replicating its findings 99% of the time. And that's why it's so easy for people like RFK Jr. to turn up their megaphone and peddle completely asinine bullshit that millions of people will not only uncritically accept, but also base their decisions like who to vote for or whether to vaccinate their kids on.

Anyway, this administration continues to sidestep transparency and honesty at every corner, so while this past weekend's dance with data manipulation is not particularly surprising to me, my faith in our economic and health institutions continues to wane as Trump and his cronies do everything in their power to undermine the people's trust in data and democracy. And for that, this country should feel ashamed.

[^3]: <small>I had a friend recently claim that putting ice on your testicles can boost testosterone; he didn't cite a study as I'm sure he saw this in either a TikTok or YouTube video, but I guarantee that if I asked him to produce a study that provides evidence supporting this claim, he'd somehow be able to cherry-pick the one random n = 30 ScienceSlop paper from the 80s that vaguely supports the claim. Or, he'd pivot to defending the idea that since high temperature reduces sperm motility, it stands to reason that cooling your ballsack increases sperm production which somehow correlates to higher testosterone production. I'm basically picking a fight against an imagined caricature of this friend in my blog footnotes, so if he's willing to defend this idea with a formal piece, he's free to send it my way.</small>
